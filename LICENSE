The Spiritual License (SL)

If you're a licensing lawyer, get the fuck out. You ain't making any money
from this shit. Because this is gold. ;)

This software is hereby offered free of charge and ownership to anyone
who wants to make this world a better place to live.
I am a man who believes the ideas we get are not our own. I believe that these
ideas (like the idea of creating this piece software) are communicated to us
by our higher beings. Therefore claiming ownership (even if I am the one who
brought it to fruition) over them is just as arrogant as saying just because I
saw that chick first, she, therefore, is my property. Let's not be a dick and
try and be under the illusion that we own something. The truth is, we don't own
jack shit. A few years from now, we all are gonna go back to where we come from
we ain't carrying anything there. So why bother possessing it here?

You are free to take this code and do whatever the fuck you want with it. You
can change my name and claim it as your own creation. What's important to me is
that this message gets spread out. Doesn't matter under whose name it goes.

My only hope is that whoever uses it, does so in good spirit and with an
intention of bringing good to others.

Now, stop reading and do something awesome. I grant you the freedom for doing
great things. Be assured that as long as you do good, my good will is always
backing you up - whether you realize it or not.

To the lawyers - If you slightly felt that I was being insulting towards you or
your profession, I apologize. Instead of getting outraged, you can choose to
consider this a great help for not wasting your time. Take this time you saved
invest it in studying other licenses that may encourage other human beings to
fuck each other over in terminologies. :)

I love you all. :D
